  <h2>From "OHMYGOD"</h2>
  <h3>
<p>An alliance of gods from all over the world. &nbsp;A.K.A."Pantheon".</p>
</h3>
<div>
<p>Officially founded in 1703, this new god organization spans all seven continents and is present in 63 different parts of the world.</p>
<p>[The following is an excerpt from the stele of Gyak Bramk, &nbsp;the first general president of GCU, in Amdo, Tibet.]<br>
"In the past, when gods, demons and human co-existed, we were divided by regions due to the lack of information sharing and the weakness of the old gods in different parts of the world, and there were thousands of protoss tribes with vastly different cultures, languages and regions. <br>
"Through the different versions of myths and legends that circulate around the world, we have a tacit understanding that there must be others outside our own region who share our own powers, 
<br>"power of the GOD."</p>
<p>Today, the organization has become the world's largest and most sophisticated new God group, and it continues to recruit the elite of the era. <br>
Adhering to the belief of inclusiveness, diversity and evolution, it has seven sub-organizations on seven continents, each with its own management and governance system. <br>
Among them, the largest and most complex sub-organization is it's Asian organization. </p>
